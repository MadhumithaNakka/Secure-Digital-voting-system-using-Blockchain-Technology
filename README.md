# Secure-Digital-voting-system-using-Blockchain-Technology
There is a fact many operations both administrative and fintech that can only be done offline can now safely moved to Internet as online services because of immutability of Blockchain. Smart contracts are the meaningful pieces of codes, to be integrated in the blockchain and executed as scheduled in every step of blockchain updates. The Blockchain with smart contracts emerges as a good candidate to use in development of safer, cheaper, more transparent and easy to use e-voting systems. Due to its consistency, widespread use and provision of smart contracts logic - “Ethereum” and its network is one of the most suitable ones.This project aims implementing an e-voting system which must be secure, as it should not allow duplicated votes and fully transparent, while protecting the privacy of the attendees.

Within this context, the system is designed using a web-based interface to facilitate user engagement with measures such as finger printing to protect against double voting. With a clear need to administer the voters, constituencies and candidates for constituencies, a user-friendly administrator interface is implemented to enable ease of access.Furthermore, the system allows all voters equal rights of participation and develops a fair and healthy competition among all the candidates while keeping the anonymity of the voters preserved. The cryptographic hash of the transaction (ID) is emailed to the voter as a proof that the vote has been casted which may later on be tracked outside the premises of the constituency.
